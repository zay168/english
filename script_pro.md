**Zayd:** And now, the meteorological forecast. Elicha, what does the satellite data indicate?
**Elicha:** Thank you, Zayd. Looking at the isobaric pressure map, we have a significant low-pressure system moving in from the Atlantic.
**Zayd:** That explains the high humidity levels we experienced this morning.

**Zayd:** Meanwhile, in the south of France, a high-pressure ridge is keeping the sky clear.
**Elicha:** Yes, temperatures in Marseille are peaking at 35 degrees Celsius due to a warm front coming from the Mediterranean.
