### [SCENE 1: INTRO]
**(Music fades in - Both anchors looking serious at the camera)**

**Zayn:** Good morning. I’m Zayn.
**Elicha:** And I’m Elicha.
**Zayn:** And this is The 10:00 Report. Breaking news from Sevigné High School...
**Elicha:** ...students are reportedly "very tired" and asking where the weekend went. But first, our top stories.

### [SCENE 2: BREAKING NEWS - TYPEWRITERS & AI]
**(Visual Change needing Projector: BREAKING NEWS Graphic)**

**Zayn:** Our main story tonight: Technology. It’s moving fast. Too fast?
**Elicha:** That’s right, Zayn. A recent report shows that Artificial Intelligence is now smart enough to do our math homework... but it still refuses to carry our backpacks.
**Zayn:** Truly shocking. Scientists say that by 2030, backpacks might carry *themselves*. Until then, we suffer.
**Elicha:** In other news, the school cafeteria claims today’s pasta is "Al Dente". Students are calling it "Al Crunchie". We will have a special investigation later in the program.

### [SCENE 3: INTERNATIONAL NEWS]
**(Visual Change: WORLD MAP)**

**Zayn:** Turning to international news. In the United States, a man tried to sue a cat for "looking at him suspiciously."
**Elicha:** The cat won the case. The judge ruled that the cat was just... being a cat.
**Zayn:** Incredible. Meanwhile, in London, the King was seen drinking tea.
**Elicha:** In other breaking news: Water is wet. Back to you, Zayn.

### [SCENE 4: COMMERCIAL BREAK (Fake Ad)]
**(Visual Change: PRODUCT LOGO - "L'EAU DE STRESS")**

**Zayn:** We’ll be right back after this short break.
**Elicha:** Are you tired? Do you have three tests tomorrow?
**Zayn:** Try "L’Eau de Stress". The new perfume by Sevigné.
**Elicha:** Use it, and you will smell like panic and coffee.
**Zayn:** "L’Eau de Stress". Available at the CDI now.

### [SCENE 5: THE WEATHER (Mandatory Segment)]
**(Visual Change: WEATHER MAP)**

**Elicha:** And now, the weather. Zayn, what is happening out there?
**Zayn:** *(Walks to the map/Points at the board)* Well Elicha, it’s looking interesting.
**Zayn:** As you can see here in the north, specifically in London, it is raining cats and dogs.
**Elicha:** Literally?
**Zayn:** No, figuratively. But bring an umbrella. It’s 10 degrees and very grey. Typical British summer.
**Zayn:** Moving down to Paris... it’s actually sunny! Rare, I know. Temperatures are a nice 22 degrees. Perfect for avoiding homework in the park.
**Elicha:** What about the South?
**Zayn:** Down here in Marseille, it’s a heatwave. 35 degrees. Everyone is at the beach while we are here in class.
**Elicha:** Unfair.
**Zayn:** And finally, in the Alps... snow? Yes, actually, just a little bit. If you like skiing in September, go now.
**Zayn:** So, expect sun in Paris, rain in London, and jealousy everywhere else. Back to the desk.

### [SCENE 6: OUTRO]
**(Visual Change: STUDIO BACKGROUND)**

**Elicha:** Thank you for that report, Zayn.
**Zayn:** That concludes our broadcast for today.
**Elicha:** We are late for our next class, so we must go.
**Zayn:** For The 10:00 Report, I’m Zayn.
**Elicha:** And I’m Elicha.
**Both:** Stay classy, Sevigné.
